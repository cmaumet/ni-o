### Neuroimaging Data Sharing Ontology (NI-O)

NI-O is an application ontology focused on neuroimaging data sharing. Our goal is to incorporate external ontology classes and heirarchies (e.g., PROV-O and OBI) to support harmonizing disparate data models in neuroimaging.

At its core, NI-O extends the W3C PROV Ontology with classes that provide a conceptual model of specific terms for the neuroimaging domain. 

This is in a similar spirit as the NIDASH Data Model (NI-DM), which extends the PROV Data Model with neuroimaging specific terms.
