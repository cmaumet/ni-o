### NIDASH Ontology (NI-O)

NI-O is an application ontology focused on neuroimaging data sharing. Our goal is to incorporate external ontology classes and heirarchies (e.g., PROV-O, Dublin Core, FOAF, VoiD) to support harmonizing disparate data models in neuroimaging.

At its core, NI-O extends the W3C PROV Ontology with classes that provide a conceptual model of specific terms for the neuroimaging domain. These terms are also part of the NIDASH Data Model, but provide additional semantics and the ability to run a reasoner to infer additional information.
